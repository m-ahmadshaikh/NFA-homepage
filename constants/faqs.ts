    question: 'How It Works For Gamers?',
    answer:
      "Gamers play arcade style games on the NFA platform, then earn tickets as a reward based on their skill.Gamers are obsessed with earning tickets and want to earn as many as possible.\n\nTickets have two purposes in NFA:\n\n1. Gamers turn in tickets to claim limited edition digital collectibles that offer in-game utility.\n\n2. Gamers' ticket earnings provide them with a rank on the NFA leaderboard. A gamers rank on the leaderboard is based on the amount of tickets earned in a 24 hour period. The top performing gamers who earn the most tickets in any given 24 hour period are paid out in USDC on a daily basis.\n\nIn NFA, earning tickets & USDC is based on skill, giving every gamer on our platform a fair chance to earn tickets, claim limited edition digital collectibles, and win USDC prizes each day.\n\nOur total USDC prize pool in Season 1 is $500,000, which will be rewarded to the top performing gamers on a daily basis over a 6 week period.\n\nOur initial game collection is inspired by classic arcade titles like TMNT: Turtles in Time, Street Fighter 2, & more TBA.",

    question: 'How It Works For Developers?',
    answer:
      'Game developers apply for a game developer account with NFA to  launch their game on our platform for free.\n\nNFA’s proprietary software provides developers with game metrics & a fair ‘pay-per-play’ payout system that scales with the game’s popularity.\n\nOur platform helps independent game developers overcome two major hurdles:\n\n1. Marketing. Gaming has become an extremely lucrative & saturated market to compete  in. With large publishers regularly spending millions to market a game, game developers have a hard time getting eyeballs on their game & gamers playing their game. NFA’s Platform hosts games for free & provides game developers with a built in audience of gamers ready to play their games.\n\n2. Earning. For developers, publishing a game is about providing gamers with entertainment. On NFA’s platform, the developer provides the entertainment, and we provide the game metrics & tools necessary to help games scale up & find success.\n\nIn NFA, our ‘pay-per-play’ payout system provides developers with a fair opportunity to earn USDC based on popularity, giving every game developer on our platform a fair chance to earn UDC & enhance the user experience based on our proprietary data provided.',

    question: 'Elephant In The Arcade',
    answer:
      'GameFi projects are known for generating massive amounts of revenue, only to suddenly burn to the ground as the project gains traction & attracts more users. Our team at NFA has identified this as a design flaw in GameFi economics.\n\nUnlike other GameFi projects to date, NFA’s payouts scale with the total number of users on the platform. We’ve designed our ecosystem so that as more users come to NFA, more users will earn more money.',
